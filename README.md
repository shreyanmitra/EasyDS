# EasyDS

A Python library equivalent of the Java Collections framework.

While Python natively supports these data structures, this library provides clarity and rigor to their use. This is especially useful when used in conjunction with the typing library for type-checking.

It is primarily meant for use <u>by beginners</u> to Python who are used to Java syntax.

There are also functions for graph search and data structures for different type of search trees.
